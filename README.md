# Nanograd

A few notebooks exploring concepts related to neural nets. Namely neurons, MLP's, loss functions, gradient descent, and backpropagation.


Based on [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) and karpathy's intro explanation on [training neural nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&t=6246s&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy).
